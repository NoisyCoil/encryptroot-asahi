<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>encryptroot.asahi - encrypt the root partition of your Fedora Asahi
installation</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> [ <strong>--boot-label</strong>
<em>boot_label</em> ] [ <strong>-d</strong> <em>device_name</em> ] [
<strong>--root-label</strong> <em>root_label</em> ] [
<strong>-v</strong> ] <em>rootdisk</em> <em>bootdisk</em></p>
<p><strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> [ <strong>-h</strong> ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> is an interactive script that
allows you to encrypt the root partition of your Fedora Asahi
installation without deleting its contents. It is meant to be executed
from an external USB drive hosting an Asahi OS, or from a regular Linux
virtual machine running on macOS. It may horribly screw up your system
if executed from your Fedora Asahi installation (this scenario is
completely untested, please, just don't).</p>
<p>Unless you've just installed Fedora Asahi, backup your system before
running <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong>. As the user of this script,
you are expected to be able to manually recover from failure. If you are
not able to do so, please don't run
<strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>OPERATIONS</strong> section of this manpage details the
steps involved in the encryption process. The <strong>RECOVERY</strong>
section details its recovery logic. These sections can be of help if the
process fails: they contain useful information and debug steps.</p>
<p>By running <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> you agree not to hold
its author accountable for any loss of data or any other form of damage
resulting from its use.</p>

<h1>OPERATIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>0. Preliminary checks</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>We check that the root partition is formatted with the
<strong>btrfs</strong> filesystem (or with <strong>ext4</strong> if the
<strong>--ext4</strong> option is enabled) and that the boot partition
is formatted with the <strong>ext4</strong> filesystem. Then, if not
otherwise specified via the <strong>--root-label</strong> and
<strong>--boot-label</strong> options, we check that the labels of the
root and boot partions are, respectively, <strong>fedora</strong> and
<strong>BOOT</strong>. Unless the <strong>--no-subvols</strong> option
(implied by <strong>--ext4</strong>) is enabled, we check that the btrfs
root filesystem contains the <strong>root</strong> and
<strong>home</strong> subvolumes. Finally, we check that the root and
boot partitions contain the files and binaries required to complete the
encryption process.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These checks are performed in order to prevent
<strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> (or the user) from unintentionally
overwriting non-Fedora Asahi partitions (e.g. the macOS partitions), and
to make sure that the encryption process can be brought to completion.
Vanilla Fedora Asahi installations require no options to pass the checks
(if they do it's a bug, please report it if you can!)</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>1. Filesystem resizing</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The filesystem contained in your root partition needs to be shrunk to
make room for the (LUKS) headers generated during the encryption step.
This is achieved using the <strong>btrfs-filesystem</strong>(8) command
(for btrfs root filesystems),</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p># <strong>btrfs filesystem resize -32M</strong>
<em>mountpoint</em></p>
<p>or the <strong>resize2fs</strong>(8) command (for ext4 root
filesystems),</p>
<p># <strong>resize2fs</strong> <em>rootdisk</em> $((<em>oldsize</em> -
32M))</p>
<p>In the former case, whether this step was successful can be checked
by mounting the root partition and running</p>
<p># <strong>btrfs device usage</strong> <em>mountpoint</em></p>
<p>If the "<strong>Device slack</strong>" field reads 32MiB (or 16MiB
after encryption), it was successful.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>2. Full-disk encryption</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The root partition is encrypted while preserving the data (that is,
unless things go wrong) using
<strong>cryptsetup-reencrypt</strong>(8):</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p># <strong>cryptsetup reencrypt --encrypt --reduce-device-size
32M</strong> <em>rootdisk</em></p>
<p>From the moment this step starts, the system will detect the root
partition as a <strong>crypto_LUKS</strong> device (e.g. run
<strong>lsblk -ndo FSTYPE</strong> <em>rootdisk</em>); the root
partition can then be mounted using <strong>cryptsetup-open</strong>(8).
Nonetheless, the root partition is <strong>only</strong> actually fully
encrypted when this step is <strong>completed</strong>.</p>
<p>The encryption step can be interrupted and resumed at a later moment.
While this behavior is useful in the event of recovery from failure, we
advise the user not to intentionally stop the process while encryption
is in progress.</p>
<p>You can check the encryption status of the root partition by
running</p>
<p># <strong>cryptsetup luksDump</strong> <em>rootdisk</em></p>
<p>If the '<strong>Requirements</strong>' field in '<strong>LUKS header
information</strong>' exists and contains the string 'online-reencrypt',
the encryption process was interrupted and must be resumed. Otherwise it
completed successfully. Note that if the previous command complains
about <em>rootdisk</em> being an invalid LUKS device, it means that this
step never started in the first place.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>3. /etc/crypttab and grub (chroot)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The now-encrypted root partition is registered for boot-time
decryption first with the <strong>/etc/crypttab</strong> file (see also
<strong>crypttab</strong>(5)) and then with <strong>grub</strong> (see
also <strong>grub2-mkconfig</strong>(8)). This step is performed inside
a chroot.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This step was successfull if <strong>/etc/crypttab</strong> and
<strong>/etc/default/grub</strong> both contain the root disk's LUKS
UUID, which can be obtained by</p>
<p># <strong>cryptsetup luksUUID</strong> <em>rootdisk</em></p>
<p>and if the same UUID is contained in the boot partition's grub files
(usually <strong>/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</strong> and the relevant files in
<strong>/boot/loader/entries</strong>).</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>4. initramfs (chroot)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The initramfs is recreated to make sure that it can decrypt the root
partition at boot time. This step is also performed inside a chroot.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is no obvious way to check that this step was successful, other
than unpacking the initramfs and looking for
<strong>cryptsetup</strong>(8),
<strong>systemd-ask-password</strong>(1), etc., inside it.</p>
<h1>RECOVERY</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>1. Filesystem resizing</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>For btrfs root filesystems, <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong>
detects whether the root filesystem was already shrunk by 32 MiB. If
this is the case, re-running the script with the same arguments won't
resize it a second time. If you manually shrank the btrfs root
filesystem by a different amount (or if your root partition is formatted
with the ext4 filesystem), <strong>AND</strong> if the full-disk
encryption step was never initiated, re-running the script will shrink
the filesystem again by 32 MiB. And then again. And so on.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Filesystem resizing is <strong>never</strong> performed on either
partially or fully encrypted <em>rootdisk</em>s (see below).</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>2. Full-disk encryption</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>At startup, <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> detects whether the
encryption step was already attempted on <em>rootdisk</em>. If it
determines that the encryption step was interrupted while in progress,
it tries to resume it and bring it to completion. It does so by
re-executing</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p># <strong>cryptsetup reencrypt --encrypt --reduce-device-size
32M</strong> <em>rootdisk</em></p>
<p>(see <strong>cryptsetup-reencrypt</strong>(8) for the relevant
documentation). Under normal circumstances, no data corruption will
result from re-running the command.</p>
<p>If, at startup, <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> detects that
<em>rootdisk</em> is fully encrypted, for good measure it asks whether
you picked the wrong disk. If you tell it to continue, it assumes that
you're trying to resume the process from a later step, and that the root
disk you picked is the same one you used in the previous steps.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>3. /etc/crypttab and grub (chroot)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> detects whether the encrypted root
partition was already registered with <strong>/etc/crypttab</strong> and
<strong>/etc/default/grub</strong>, and doesn't do so again if it was.
If the encrypted root partition was registered with the boot partition's
grub files, it doesn't run <strong>grub2-mkconfig</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>4. initramfs (chroot)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The initramfs is always recreated. This is a routine operation and
will not cause issues under normal circumstances.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NOTE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Resuming the encryption process from the <strong>Full-disk
encryption</strong> stage or from later ones requires
<strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> to be executed with the <strong>same
arguments</strong> as its first run. The checks in step 0 (see
'<strong>OPERATIONS - 0. Preliminary checks</strong>') are still
performed, but on the decrypted device, which requires you to enter the
root disk password one additional time.</p>
