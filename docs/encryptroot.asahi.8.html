<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>encryptroot.asahi - encrypt the root partition of your Asahi
installation</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> [ <strong>--boot-label</strong>
<em>boot_label</em> ] [ <strong>--debian</strong> ] [
<strong>-d</strong> <em>device_name</em> ] [ <strong>--ext4</strong> ] [
<strong>--no-subvols</strong> ] [ <strong>--root-label</strong>
<em>root_label</em> ] [ <strong>-v</strong> ] <em>rootdisk</em>
<em>bootdisk</em></p>
<p><strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> [ <strong>-h</strong> ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> is an interactive script that
allows you to encrypt the root partition of your Asahi installation
without deleting its contents. It is meant to be executed from an
external USB drive hosting an Asahi OS, or from a regular Linux virtual
machine running on macOS. It may horribly screw up your system if
executed from your Asahi installation (this scenario is completely
untested, please, just don't). It only supports partition layouts where
the boot partition is separate from the root partition, and ext4
boot-partition filesystems.</p>
<p>There are two mode of operations: fedora mode (default) and debian
mode. When running in fedora mode, <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong>
performs preliminary checks under the assumption that you are encrypting
an official Fedora Asahi Remix installation. Some of these assumptions
can be relaxed by suitable options (see below). When running in debian
mode, it performs fewer checks due to the fact that there is no standard
Debian Asahi installation. As long as you pass the correct
<em>rootdisk</em> and <em>bootdisk</em> arguments and follow
instructions, this will not be less secure than operating in fedora
mode.</p>
<p>Unless you've just installed Asahi Linux, backup your system before
running <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong>. As the user of this script,
you are expected to be able to manually recover from failure. If you are
not able to do so, please don't run
<strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>OPERATIONS</strong> section of this manpage details the
steps involved in the encryption process. The <strong>RECOVERY</strong>
section details its recovery logic. These sections can be of help if the
process fails: they contain useful information and debug steps.</p>
<p>By running <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> you agree not to hold
its author accountable for any loss of data or any other form of damage
resulting from its use.</p>

<h1>OPERATIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>0. Preliminary checks</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>We check that the root partition is formatted with the
<strong>btrfs</strong> filesystem (or with <strong>ext4</strong> if the
<strong>--ext4</strong> option is enabled) and that the boot partition
is formatted with the <strong>ext4</strong> filesystem. Then, if not
otherwise specified via the <strong>--root-label</strong> and
<strong>--boot-label</strong> options and not running in debian mode, we
check that the labels of the root and boot partions are, respectively,
<strong>fedora</strong> and <strong>BOOT</strong>. Unless the
<strong>--no-subvols</strong> option (implied by
<strong>--ext4</strong>) is enabled, we check that the btrfs root
filesystem contains the <strong>root</strong> and <strong>home</strong>
subvolumes. Finally, we check that the root and boot partitions contain
the files and binaries required to complete the encryption process.</p>
<p>These checks are performed in order to prevent
<strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> (or the user) from unintentionally
overwriting non-Asahi partitions (e.g. the macOS partitions), and to
make sure that the encryption process can be brought to completion.
Vanilla Fedora Asahi installations require no options to pass the checks
(if they do it's a bug, please report it if you can!)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>1. Filesystem resizing</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The filesystem contained in your root partition needs to be shrunk to
make room for the (LUKS) headers generated during the encryption step.
This is achieved using the <strong>btrfs-filesystem</strong>(8) command
(for btrfs root filesystems),</p>
<p># <strong>btrfs filesystem resize -32M</strong>
<em>mountpoint</em></p>
<p>or the <strong>resize2fs</strong>(8) command (for ext4 root
filesystems),</p>
<p># <strong>resize2fs</strong> <em>rootdisk</em> $((<em>oldsize</em> -
32M))</p>
<p>In the former case, whether this step was successful can be checked
by mounting the root partition and running</p>
<p># <strong>btrfs device usage</strong> <em>mountpoint</em></p>
<p>If the "<strong>Device slack</strong>" field reads 32MiB (or 16MiB
after encryption), it was successful. In the latter case the check is a
bit more involved: first run</p>
<p># <strong>dumpe2fs</strong> <em>rootdisk</em> | <strong>grep</strong>
"^Block \(size\|count\)"</p>
<p>to get the block size and block count of the root disk, then multiply
them together. This will give you the size (in bytes) of the root
filesystem. Then get the size of the root partition in bytes by
running</p>
<p># <strong>lsblk -no SIZE --bytes</strong> <em>rootdisk</em></p>
<p>If the difference between the root partition size and the root
filesystem size is 32MiB (or 16 MiB after encryption, in case you run
the above commands on the decrypted root disk device), the step was
successful.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>2. Full-disk encryption</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The root partition is encrypted while preserving the data (that is,
unless things go wrong) using
<strong>cryptsetup-reencrypt</strong>(8):</p>
<p># <strong>cryptsetup reencrypt --encrypt --reduce-device-size
32M</strong> <em>rootdisk</em></p>
<p>From the moment this step starts, the system will detect the root
partition as a <strong>crypto_LUKS</strong> device (e.g. run
<strong>lsblk -ndo FSTYPE</strong> <em>rootdisk</em>); the root
partition can then be mounted using <strong>cryptsetup-open</strong>(8).
Nonetheless, the root partition is <strong>only</strong> actually fully
encrypted when this step is <strong>completed</strong>.</p>
<p>The encryption step can be interrupted and resumed at a later moment.
While this behavior is useful in the event of recovery from failure, we
advise you not to intentionally stop the process while encryption is in
progress.</p>
<p>You can check the encryption status of the root partition by
running</p>
<p># <strong>cryptsetup luksDump</strong> <em>rootdisk</em></p>
<p>If the '<strong>Requirements</strong>' field in '<strong>LUKS header
information</strong>' exists and contains the string 'online-reencrypt',
the encryption process was interrupted and must be resumed. Otherwise it
completed successfully. Note that if the previous command complains
about <em>rootdisk</em> being an invalid LUKS device, it means that this
step never started in the first place.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>3. /etc/crypttab and grub (chroot)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The now encrypted root partition is registered for boot-time
decryption first with the <strong>/etc/crypttab</strong> file (see also
<strong>crypttab</strong>(5)) and then with <strong>grub</strong> (see
also <strong>grub2-mkconfig</strong>(8)). This step is performed inside
a chroot.</p>
<p>This step was successfull if <strong>/etc/crypttab</strong> and
<strong>/etc/default/grub</strong> both contain the root disk's LUKS
UUID, which can be obtained by</p>
<p># <strong>cryptsetup luksUUID</strong> <em>rootdisk</em></p>
<p>and if the same UUID is contained in the boot partition's grub files
(usually <strong>/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</strong> and the relevant files in
<strong>/boot/loader/entries</strong> for fedora, or /boot/grub/grub.cfg
for debian).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>4. initramfs (chroot)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The initramfs is recreated to make sure that it can decrypt the root
partition at boot time. This step is also performed inside a chroot.</p>
<p>There is no obvious way to check that this step was successful, other
than unpacking the initramfs and looking for
<strong>cryptsetup</strong>(8),
<strong>systemd-ask-password</strong>(1),
<strong>cryptroot-unlock</strong>, etc., inside it.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>RECOVERY</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>1. Filesystem resizing</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> detects whether the root
filesystem is at least 32 MiB smaller than the root partition. If it is,
the filesystem is not shrunk. In particular, re-running
<strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> with the same arguments as a previous
run will not resize the root filesystem.</p>
<p>In any case, filesystem resizing is <strong>never</strong> performed
on either partially or fully encrypted <em>rootdisk</em>s, nor on their
decrypted content.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>2. Full-disk encryption</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>At startup, <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> detects whether the
encryption step was already attempted on <em>rootdisk</em>. If it
determines that the encryption step was interrupted while in progress,
it tries to resume it and bring it to completion. It does so by
re-executing</p>
<p># <strong>cryptsetup reencrypt --encrypt --reduce-device-size
32M</strong> <em>rootdisk</em></p>
<p>(see <strong>cryptsetup-reencrypt</strong>(8) for the relevant
documentation). Under normal circumstances, no data corruption should
result from re-running the command.</p>
<p>If, at startup, <strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> detects that
<em>rootdisk</em> is fully encrypted, for good measure it asks whether
you picked the wrong disk. If you tell it to continue, it assumes that
you're trying to resume the process from a later step, and that the root
disk you picked is the same one you used in the previous steps.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>3. /etc/crypttab and grub (chroot)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> detects whether the encrypted root
partition was already registered with <strong>/etc/crypttab</strong> and
<strong>/etc/default/grub</strong>, and doesn't do so again if it was.
If the encrypted root partition was registered with the boot partition's
grub files, it doesn't run <strong>grub2-mkconfig</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>4. initramfs (chroot)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The initramfs is always recreated. This is a routine operation and
will not cause issues under normal circumstances.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>NOTE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Resuming the encryption process from the <strong>Full-disk
encryption</strong> stage or from later ones requires
<strong>encryptroot.asahi</strong> to be executed with the <strong>same
arguments</strong> as its first run. The checks in step 0 (see
'<strong>OPERATIONS - 0. Preliminary checks</strong>') are still
performed, but on the decrypted device, which requires you to enter the
root disk password one additional time.</p>
